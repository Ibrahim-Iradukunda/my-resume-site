          Did you know that your fingerprints are not only unique to you but are
          also formed before you are born? By the time you are about six months
          old in the womb, your fingerprints are fully developed. No two
          fingerprints are the same, even among identical twins. So, you truly
          have your own special mark on the world, quite literally! ðŸŒŸ

            I am an ambitious & driven goal-setter who thrives when challenged.
            I strive to navigate the world with integrity, ensuring I cause no
            harm. Iâ€™m a self-motivated and cheerful person towards my goals and

            <strong>Personal Story:</strong> Once when I was a child, I used to
            steal my parents' money. From this, I learned that every action has
            its consequences. Moving forward, I decided to never steal again and
            work hard to earn my own money, making my parents proud.

            <strong>Belief:</strong> I believed that people with disabilities
            can't engage in engineering fields. After an accident, I thought it
            would be impossible for me to pursue software engineering. However,
            I decided to learn about the experiences and contributions of people
            with disabilities in engineering fields and speak up against
            stereotypes.
