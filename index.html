          Did you know that your fingerprints are not only unique to you but are
          also formed before you are born? By the time you are about six months
          old in the womb, your fingerprints are fully developed. No two
          fingerprints are the same, even among identical twins. So, you truly
          have your own special mark on the world, quite literally! ðŸŒŸ

          I am an ambitious & driven goal-setter who thrives when challenged. I
          strive to navigate the world with integrity, ensuring I cause no harm.
          Iâ€™m a self-motivated and cheerful person towards my goals and life.

        <p class="card">
          <strong>Personal Story:</strong> Once when I was a child, I used to
          steal my parents' money. From this, I learned that every action has
          its consequences. Moving forward, I decided to never steal again and
          work hard to earn my own money, making my parents proud.
        </p>
        <p class="card">
          <strong>Belief:</strong> I believed that people with disabilities
          can't engage in engineering fields. After an accident, I thought it
          would be impossible for me to pursue software engineering. However, I
          decided to learn about the experiences and contributions of people
          with disabilities in engineering fields and speak up against
          stereotypes.

        <p class="card">
          <strong>Value:</strong> Integrity is the most important value in my
          life. I believe that working with integrity is essential for building
          trust, credibility, and ethical leadership.
        </p>
        <p class="card">
          <strong>Prejudice:</strong> I recognized my own ableism and learned to
          challenge this prejudice to promote inclusivity and understanding.
        </p>
        <p class="card">
          <strong>Ikigai:</strong> I am good at cartoon editing and video
          lyrics. I love editing pictures in my free time and can be paid for
          it. My ikigai is to become a world editor who contributes to
          high-quality editing of pictures and video lyrics.
        </p>
        <p class="card">
          <strong>Mission:</strong> My mission is to build a successful life in
